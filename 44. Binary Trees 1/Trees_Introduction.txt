# Trees Are Non-Linear Data Structures In Which A Single Node Can Point To Multiple Nodes Called Its Children.
# The First Or The Top-Most NOde Is Called The Root Node.
# Trees Has No Self Loops Or A Node Can't Point To Itself.
# Trees Has No Loops And No Circuits.

# Terminologies To Trees:-
*) Root  Node      : The Top Node Of A Tree Is Its Root Node.
*) Child Node      : All The Nodes To Which The Current Node Points Are Its Children Node.
*) Parent Node     : The Node Pointing To The Current Node Is Its Parent Node.
*) Sibling Node    : All The Nodes Having Same Parent Node Are Sibling Nodes.
*) Leaf Node       : Nodes With No Children Are Leaf Nodes.
*) Ancestor Node   : All The Nodes Falling In The Shortest Path From Root Node To Current Node Except
                     The Current Node Itself Are Its Ancestor Nodes.
*) Descendant Node : All The Nodes That Are Connected To Current Node And Are Present Below It.
*) Levels Of Tree  : The Number Of Generations Present In The Tree.
*) Size Of Tree    : Total Number Of Nodes Present In The Tree.
*) Height Of Tree  : Level Of Tree - 1
*) Number Of Edges : Number Of Edges Present In The Representation Of The Tree Size - 1.

# Types Of Trees :-
*) Generic Trees : In These Trees Each Node Can Have Any Number Of Children.
*) Binary Trees  : In These Trees Each Node Can Have Upto Two Child Nodes.
*) Binary Search : Binary Trees In Which The Values Of All Left Descendants Is Less And The Values
   Trees           Of All Right Descendants Is Greater Than The Value Of Current Node.
*) AVL Trees     : Balanced Binary Search Trees Are AVl Trees.

// Applications :
*) Used To Store Data In Hierarchical Form.
*) Special Purpose Trees Are Used In Operations Like Sorting And Searching.
